# Untrusted
Note: Untrusted is not a commercial product. It's just a fork of Stockfish. 

Modified to win in Blitz games. 
Contempt was reintroduced. 
Minor changes in uci options and other parts. 
NNUE support. 
There is "untrusted-nnue.bin" in the src folder, not built-in. 
Use with my polyglot book(untrusted.bin) for best results.
